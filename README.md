# Sentiment_Analysis

Performance Comparison
Naive Bayes Classifier:

Accuracy: 0.737 (73%)
Speed: Naive Bayes classifiers are computationally efficient and fast, making them ideal for large datasets or real-time applications where quick predictions are necessary.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where speed and resource efficiency are critical, and slightly lower accuracy is acceptable.
Random Forest Classifier:

Accuracy: 0.916 (91%)
Speed: Random Forest classifiers are more computationally intensive and take longer to train and predict due to the ensemble nature of the model (building multiple decision trees and averaging their results).
Use Case: Ideal for applications where higher accuracy is crucial and there are sufficient computational resources and time for training and prediction.
Final Conclusion
Accuracy vs. Speed:

The Random Forest classifier offers significantly higher accuracy, making it more effective for sentiment analysis in this context. However, this comes at the cost of increased training and prediction time.
The Naive Bayes classifier, while less accurate, is much faster and more efficient, making it suitable for situations where rapid results are needed or computational resources are limited.
Model Selection:

If the primary goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy and there are adequate resources and time, the Random Forest classifier is the preferred choice.
If the goal is to perform quick, real-time sentiment analysis or work within resource constraints, the Naive Bayes classifier would be more appropriate.
