Performance Comparison
Naive Bayes Classifier:

Accuracy: 0.737 (73%)
Speed: Naive Bayes classifiers are computationally efficient and fast, making them ideal for large datasets or real-time applications where quick predictions are necessary.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where speed and resource efficiency are critical, and slightly lower accuracy is acceptable.

If the primary goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy and there are adequate resources and time, the Random Forest classifier is the preferred choice.
If the goal is to perform quick, real-time sentiment analysis or work within resource constraints, the Naive Bayes classifier would be more appropriate.
